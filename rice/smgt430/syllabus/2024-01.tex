\textbf{\textsc{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  After successfully completing this course, you will be able to:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use R to apply theoretical statistical models to real-world sports data, and interpret the results.
    \item Calculate estimates of team and player strengths, adjusting for sample size and strength of schedule.
    \item Estimate in-game win probability models based on game state (e.g. score, possession, time remaining).
    \item Identify an interesting research problem in sports, solve it with data, and present your solution.
  \end{itemize}
\end{adjustwidth}

\textbf{\textsc{What You Need to Know}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  \textbf{ThuRsday.} Thursday is R day. Please bring your laptop to class every Thursday because we will work through interactive R exercises to practice what we've been learning.

  \textbf{Exit Tickets and Quizzes.} We will use the final 15 minutes of almost every class to complete an exit ticket (anonymous) and a quiz (not anonymous). The purpose of the exit ticket is to collect feedback on the class. The purpose of the quiz is to practice retrieving information from memory, which is an effective way to learn things (according to pedagogical research). Quizzes are cumulative, not just based on the day's material.

  \textbf{Classmate Interaction.} In the middle of almost every class period, we will break out for $1$-on-$1$ discussions between classmates. The purpose is to give you a mental break and an opportunity to get to know your classmates. You are encouraged to find a different discussion partner every day.

  \textbf{Guest Speakers.} We plan to have $3$-$4$ guest speakers during the semester depending on availability.

\textbf{\textsc{How Your Grade Is Determined}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
	Sport analytics is a demanding and highly competitive field. This class aims to provide the tough but honest feedback that you will need to succeed in it.

	\textbf{Assignments.} ($45\%$) Assignments \#$1$--\#$6$ are individual assignments. You are encouraged to help each other, but your submission must reflect work you have done yourself. These first six assignments will be graded anonymously, so please remove any personally identifying information from your submission. Assignment \#$7$ may be completed individually or in pairs (no more than two students).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Assignment \#$1$ ($5\%$): Sports Data                       \hfill  expected hours: $2$
    \item Assignment \#$2$ ($5\%$): Regression to the Mean            \hfill  expected hours: $5$
    \item Assignment \#$3$ ($5\%$): Pythagorean Formula               \hfill  expected hours: $5$
    \item Assignment \#$4$ ($5\%$): Bradley-Terry Model               \hfill  expected hours: $5$
    \item Assignment \#$5$ ($10\%$): Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus  \hfill  expected hours: $10$
    \item Assignment \#$6$ ($10\%$): Win Probability Models           \hfill  expected hours: $10$
    \item Assignment \#$7$ ($5\%$): YouTube Short                     \hfill  expected hours: $5$
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Project.} ($40\%$) This is a project-based course, and the project you build in stages over the course of the semester will determine a large chunk of your grade. Projects may be completed individually or in pairs (no more than two students).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Project \#$0$ ($0\%$): Registration                   \hfill expected hours: $1$
    \item Project \#$1$ ($5\%$): Proposal                       \hfill expected hours: $5$
    \item Project \#$2$ ($10\%$): Abstract                      \hfill expected hours: $10$
    \item Project \#$3$ ($5\%$): Presentation                   \hfill expected hours: $5$
    \item Project \#$4$ ($20\%$): Paper + YouTube Short         \hfill expected hours: $20$
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Quizzes.} ($10\%$) We have a total of 24 quizzes planned for the semester. These are intended as low-stakes opportunities to test your learning, not as high-stakes assessments.

  \textbf{Classmate Interaction.} ($5\%$) We will have a total of approximately 24 opportunities for ``discussion break'' interactions during the semester. Your grade for this component will be equal to the percentage of classmates with whom you have had at least one discussion during these breaks.

  \textbf{Late Work.} You may submit late work, subject to a $1$-point deduction for each late day ($24$-hour period).

  \textbf{Absence Policy.} Please notify me in advance if you are going to miss a class period.

\textbf{\textsc{Title IX Responsible Employee Notification}}

  At Rice University, unlawful discrimination in any form, including sexual misconduct, is prohibited under Rice Policy on Harassment and Sexual Harassment (Policy 830) and the Student Code of Conduct.

  Please be aware that all employees of Rice University are ``mandatory reporters'', which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.

  Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

  To report sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at titleix@rice.edu. To explore supportive measures and other resources that are available to you, please visit the Office if Interpersonal Misconduct Prevention and Support at safe.rice.edu.

\textbf{\textsc{Consent for IRB Protocol FY2024-47}}
\begin{adjustwidth}{1cm}{0cm}
  This semester your instructor is participating in a study looking at teaching and learning. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of the Center for Teaching Excellence's Instructor Network to Support Teaching Innovation and eLevate Learning (INSTILL) program. As part of that evaluation, your instructor will share data from this course with the CTE; no personally identifiable student information will be saved. Your participation in this study will last for the duration of the current semester and will entail activities no different from the regular activities you would otherwise engage in as part of the course. If you would like more information, please do not hesitate to ask.  If you would like to opt out of the study, please talk to your instructor as soon as possible.
