2:30-2:40 small talk

2:40-2:55 discuss Pythagorean formula
- What is the Pythagorean formula?
- What is the purpose of the Pythagorean formula?
- How might a baseball executive leverage the Pythagorean formula in their decision-making?

2:55-3:00 Think for yourself: At what number of games do we prefer actual winning percentage over Pythagorean winning percentage?

3:00-3:05 Pair discussion

3:05-3:10 Larger group discussion

3:10-3:30 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record

3:30-3:45 students complete Canvas "quiz"

Reflection
- I badly botched the lecture portion (need to choose less confusing notation)
- Everything before then was going well enough

Subjective Rating 1/5

## 2024-01-11

Notes:
- Start by re-explaining the previous lecture with better notation

2:30-2:35 re-explain the previous lecture with better notation

2:35-2:55 Parts 1-3 of ThuRsday script

2:55-3:00 Think for yourself: Propose a model that projects a team's record based on run differential that is different from the Pythagorean formula.

3:05-3:10 Group discussion

3:10-3:30 Parts 4-6 of ThuRsday script

Reflection
- The R exercises were too challenging. Need to be more careful about the starting point I give to students so that they can get through all of the material.

All Rice classes cancelled because of cold

## 2024-01-18

Notes
- Ask for a recap of what we learned about Pythagorean record last week (We learned where wins come from---runs. Where do runs come from? Today!)
- Review missed quiz questions
- Discuss what "true talent" means

2:30-2:35 Review from last week

2:35-2:55 Base-out run expectancy and linear weights lecture

2:55-3:10 Think for yourself / pair discussion / group discussion
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of RE24 and LW relative to each other?
- Follow-up: If you were creating a WAR metric, which would you use as the basis for batter evaluation?
- Follow-up: What reasons might the residual RE24 - LW reflect true talent rather than luck?

3:10-3:30 Regression to the mean lecture

3:30-3:45 students complete exit ticket and quiz

Reflection
- I made a mistake and incorrectly defined Z_j on the chalkboard
- Students seemed to follow along for the most part
- Forgot to review missed quiz questions and discuss what "true talent" means!!

- What do you dislike about linear weights?
- How could one use the same information in a better way?

3:10-3:30 R tutorial part 2

3:30-3:45 students complete exit ticket and quiz

Reflections
- I presented part 1 from 2:40-2:55 (finished 10 minutes later than expected)
- Students worked on part 1 exercises from 2:55-3:05
- I talked through the part 1 exercises from 3:05-3:20
- Discussed strengths and weaknesses of LW 3:20-3:25
- Students worked on exit ticket and quiz starting at 3:25
- We did not cover part 2 of the R tutorial
- My pacing was really bad. Need to find a solution.

2:30-2:40 Run through the second half of last R tutorial

2:40-3:00 Batted ball outcome model lecture part 1

3:00-3:15 Think for yourself / pair discussion / group discussion
- Imagine you are a general manager getting ready for the trade deadline. You can choose between knowing LW or xLW3 for all batters. Which do you choose, and why?

3:15-3:30 Batted ball outcome model lecture part 2

3:30-3:45 students complete exit ticket and quiz

Reflections
- Students seemed really engaged on this lecture
- Covering R tutorial took 15 minutes (budgeted 10)
- Gave students 10 minutes for quiz instead of 15

2:30-2:50 Introduce BABIP, FIP and DIPS
- What do you know about BABIP? (it's noisy)
- What implications does this have for evaluating batters?
  - Connect it to RE24 -> LW -> xLW3 -> xLW2 -> xLW1
- What implications does this have for evaluating pitchers?
- DIPS = Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics
- FIP = (13 * HR + 3 * (BB + HBP) - 2 * K) / IP
  - Due to Voros McCracken (early 2000s)

2:50-3:05 Discuss 2023 NL Cy Young Voting
- Blake Snell
  - 14-9, 2.25 ERA, 3.44 FIP, 180 IP, 4.1 fWAR, 6.0 rWAR
- Zack Wheeler
  - 13-6, 3.61 ERA, 3.15 FIP, 192 IP, 5.9 fWAR, 4.3 rWAR
- Which player would you vote for, for Cy Young
- Which player would you rather have on your team in 2024?

3:05-3:30 Discuss Homework #2
- How does all of the analysis we did for batters change if we're evaluating pitchers?
- Talk about xLW0. What would K%_0 and BB%_0 be?

Reflections
- As far as low-structure discussions go, this one wasn't bad

2:40-3:20 students work on R tutorial at their own pace

3:20-3:30 go over one solution together as a class

3:30-3:45 students complete exit ticket and quiz

Reflections
- This format worked really well
  - Very little talking by me, just pasted solutions into colab doc every 10 minutes
  - Cycled through students asking "how's it going? any questions?"
  - Lots of time with hands on keyboard

Notes
"The difference between sigma^2_epsilon and sigma^2_epsilon / n is still a bit confusing to me, not sure where we should have used each one in this assignment"
