2:30-2:40 small talk

2:40-2:55 discuss Pythagorean formula
- What is the Pythagorean formula?
- What is the purpose of the Pythagorean formula?

Notes:
- Start by re-explaining the previous lecture with better notation

2:30-2:35 re-explain the previous lecture with better notation

2:30-2:50 Introduce BABIP, FIP and DIPS
- What do you know about BABIP? (it's noisy)
- What implications does this have for evaluating batters?
  - Connect it to RE24 -> LW -> xLW3 -> xLW2 -> xLW1
- What implications does this have for evaluating pitchers?
- DIPS = Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics
- FIP = (13 * HR + 3 * (BB + HBP) - 2 * K) / IP
  - Due to Voros McCracken (early 2000s)

2:50-3:05 Discuss 2023 NL Cy Young Voting

- Zack Wheeler
  - 13-6, 3.61 ERA, 3.15 FIP, 192 IP, 5.9 fWAR, 4.3 rWAR
- Which player would you vote for, for Cy Young
- Which player would you rather have on your team in 2024?

3:05-3:30 Discuss Homework #2

    - Baseball-Reference also uses fixed values that were calculated ca. 2008, only they were done by Sean Smith (aka rallymonkey or Rally) using TZR (which is based public Retrosheet data). I couldnâ€™t find an original source for these numbers, but given that Rally was active on Tangoâ€™s blog, I would bet that the methodologies are similar.
