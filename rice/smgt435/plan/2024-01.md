- What is the Pythagorean formula?
- What is the purpose of the Pythagorean formula?
- How might a baseball executive leverage the Pythagorean formula in their decision-making?

2:55-3:00 Think for yourself: At what number of games do we prefer actual winning percentage over Pythagorean winning percentage?

3:00-3:05 Pair discussion

3:05-3:10 Larger group discussion

3:10-3:30 Lesson on regression to the mean vis-a-vis Pythagorean record

3:30-3:45 students complete Canvas "quiz"

Reflection
- I badly botched the lecture portion (need to choose less confusing notation)
- Everything before then was going well enough

Subjective Rating 1/5

Notes:
- Start by re-explaining the previous lecture with better notation

2:30-2:35 re-explain the previous lecture with better notation

2:35-2:55 Parts 1-3 of ThuRsday script

2:55-3:00 Think for yourself: Propose a model that projects a team's record based on run differential that is different from the Pythagorean formula.

- Review missed quiz questions
- Discuss what "true talent" means

2:30-2:35 Review from last week

2:35-2:55 Base-out run expectancy and linear weights lecture

2:55-3:10 Think for yourself / pair discussion / group discussion
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of RE24 and LW relative to each other?
- Follow-up: If you were creating a WAR metric, which would you use as the basis for batter evaluation?
- Follow-up: What reasons might the residual RE24 - LW reflect true talent rather than luck?
