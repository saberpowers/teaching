According to the author's model, which team had the strongest defense in the 2016-17 English Premier League?

According to the author's model, where did Arsenal's offense rank among all teams in the 2016-17 English Premier League?

Suppose we add a match to the dataset in which a new club, AFC Richmond, at home, defeat West Ham 3-2. How would the estimated model coefficients change?
- What is the objective of logistic regression? (maximize the log-likelihood)
  - We've already maximized the likelihood on the rest of the data
- What's the best possible likelihood we could get for this new game?
  log(P(Y = 3)) = log(lambda^3 * exp(lambda) / 3!)
                = 3 * log(lambda) - lambda - log(3!)
  d / dlambda = 3 / lambda - 1 = 0
    => lambda = 3   <--- 3 is the number of goals scored. Coincidence? (no)
- How can we achieve that value of lambda for this new game?
  log(3) = 0.37 + beta + 0.35
  1.10 = beta + 0.72
  beta = 0.38
